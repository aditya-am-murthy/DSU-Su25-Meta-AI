# Project Introduction: Video Similarity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing, developing, and testing a custom video similarity analysis machine learning model. Below are key details about the project schedule, meetings, and setup instructions.

### Project Schedule and Office Hours
- **Notebook Releases**: Project notebooks will be released incrementally every Sunday. Note that for Week 2, the notebook will be released early, as I will be unavailable on July 27, 2025.
- **Office Hour Meetings**: We will hold office hour meetings to discuss code exercises, content, or material-related questions on the following dates:
  - Sunday, July 20, 2025
  - Wednesday, July 23, 2025
  - Friday, July 25, 2025
- **Preparation**: Members are encouraged to complete the notebooks before attending office hours to facilitate meaningful discussions about exercises or concepts.
- **Final Project**: Project members will design, develop, and test their own model architecture to create a custom video similarity analysis machine learning model.

### Environment Setup
To get started, follow the steps in the `README.md` to set up the code environment. If you do not have Conda installed, follow the instructions below to install it:

#### Installing Conda
1. **Download Miniconda**: Visit the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Run the Installer**:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the prompts.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal, navigate to the download directory, and run `bash Miniconda3-latest-<OS>.sh`, replacing `<OS>` with your operating system (e.g., `MacOSX-x86_64` or `Linux-x86_64`). Follow the prompts.
3. **Initialize Conda**: After installation, run `conda init` in your terminal to set up the shell. Restart your terminal to apply changes.
4. **Verify Installation**: Run `conda --version` to confirm Conda is installed correctly.
5. **Create a Project Environment**: Follow the `README.md` instructions to create a Conda environment with the required dependencies.

## Background

### Images and Pixel Values
In computers, images are represented as grids of pixels, where each pixel is a tiny square of color. Each pixel is defined by numerical values representing its color intensity. For grayscale images, a single value (typically 0 to 255) represents the brightness, where 0 is black and 255 is white. For color images, pixels are represented using the RGB model, with three values (red, green, blue), each ranging from 0 to 255, to define the color.

### Neural Networks
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each neuron processes input data, applies a mathematical transformation, and passes the result to the next layer. Neural networks learn by adjusting the weights of these connections during training to minimize errors in predictions.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid-like data, such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to apply filters that detect features like edges, textures, or shapes. These layers slide a small window (kernel) over the image to extract relevant patterns.

- **Feature Extraction**: Early layers in a CNN detect low-level features (e.g., edges, corners), while deeper layers combine these into high-level features (e.g., objects or parts of objects).
- **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps (e.g., by taking the maximum or average value in a region), making the model more computationally efficient and robust to small variations in the input.

### Video Data in This Project
For our dataset, videos are treated as a sequential collection of image frames. In the data exploration notebooks, we will perform image analysis on these individual frames to extract features and understand patterns. This analysis will serve as the foundation for building our video similarity analysis model
